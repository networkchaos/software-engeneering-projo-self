this project is made to automate the attendance process in colleges and even in work areas
use the biometric face scanning technology to achive this.

How face recognition automation works

it include anlaysis a person facial expresssion and features to achieve matching and to allow signing of the class attendance
Face: 
include distance between the eyes 
the shape of the nose 
contours of the face

procudures taken to approve a student or work college 

camera takes picture then a search for comparison in the database is done
if a match is found then the data of the picture is approved  and regestration takes place
else  no regestration for the person 

procedures

1. webcam coding
2. Encoding Generator: has to be done once if three faces they are done once but if is new you need to encode again
4. Face recpgnition: face detection
5. Database Setup
6. Add data to database
7. add images to database 
8. real time data base update 
9. limit number of attendance per day: will be a limited per student to one day. = 86400 seconds 



N/B the imgaes will be given ids because names can match in the class room



n/b database used is firebase because is open and free 





bugs: 

really slow because of real time data download 
face location rectangle refuesed to work tried fix but it refued to work tried cvzone also refused to work


TO DO
for some reason the mark attendance not printing 


recommendations:

in the future learn to use Asynchronous funtions
